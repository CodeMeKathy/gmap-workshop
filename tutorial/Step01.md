# Step01 - Enabling Google Maps APIs

[previous step](Step00.md) <----> [next step](Step02.md) | [home](../README.md)

## Adding Google Maps to our app!

As we saw in the presentation, we do this by adding the script.

First of all, though, we need to enable the APIs and get credentials!

Go to the [Google Maps Platform](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/) page.

- Click **Get Started**
- On the popup, enable all 3 APIs
- Click next and **Create New Project**
- You need to enable billing. You will not be charged anything for what we do in this workshop, since we will not use much quota. So, enter your card details to enable the APIs. After we finish the workshop you can shut down your project or disable billing, if you're worried about charging.

## Using the API key

Now that we have our API, let's add it in our code. Go to [app/scripts/mapscript.ts](app/scripts/mapscript.ts). Let's take a look here.
