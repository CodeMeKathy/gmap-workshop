# Step 00 - Setting up working environments

[next step](Step01.md) | [home](../README.md)

First of all we need to set up our working environments for Angular and Firebase development.
We will also set up git, in order for you to be able to clone the project from
GitHub.

## Make sure you have git

- Check [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for
  instructions.

- If you are a **Windows** user, check that you have installed [gitbash](https://gitforwindows.org/).

Once you install git, make sure you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, if you want
to work with git and clone code.

## Make sure nodejs and npm are installed and up to date with the latest versions

Go to your console/terminal and type:

```
node -v
```

and

```
npm -v
```

[Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) are the latest versions for your reference.
If you don't have them, please download and install!

## Install the Firebase tools CLI

Detailed instructions [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/), npm package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase-tools).

This will help us deploy in the end!

In your terminal type:

```
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

## Ready to go on

Now, are environments are ready to start developing our application!
