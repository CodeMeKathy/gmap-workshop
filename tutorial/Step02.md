# Step02 - Creating our first map

[previous step](Step01.md) <----> [next step](Step03.md) | [home](../README.md)

## Understanding the map element

Go to [app/scripts/main.ts](app/scripts/main.ts) and take a look there.

Go to `index.html` and look at the `div` with `id="map"`. Then look at `styles.scss`. See the fixed height?

## Getting familiar with the documentation

We want to add some options to our map.
The [documentation](https://developers-dot-devsite-v2-prod.appspot.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/map#MapOptions)
gives us all we need. Let's take a look.

## Moving forward

Now that we saw some samples, go to [app/scripts/map.ts](app/scripts/map.ts).
Let's look at the code and the tasks that are requested from us in the comments.
